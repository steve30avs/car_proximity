Proximity sensing for parking a car in a garage

Proximity details:
2.5 metres or more: Brightness of 0 (default standby mode)
1.5 to 2.5 metres: Leds set to green
0.8 to 1.5 metres: Leds set to yellow
0.5 to 0.8 metres: Leds set to red
0.25 to 0.5 metres: Leds set to flashing red
0.00 to 0.25 metres: Leds set back to brightness of 0 (assuming car is parked, putting back to standby)

Ideally this would be paired with either a PIR motion sensor or photoresistor to put the device in standby mode when the car is parked
